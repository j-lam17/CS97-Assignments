For the merge point M 7dd52bfd8e503316b4aa9c5767850d3985626b26, I see that
it is merging two different changes, one for improved documentation
by Eli Zaretskii and one added note by Stefan Kangas. Glen Morris 
has merged them together. The children are the two noted nodes, and the 
child is fixing bad dimensions by J. Scott Berg. The bottom right
subwindow is for comments, bottom left is for the output of the git diff
command, upper right is the DAG for the repo, and the upper right and 
middle are time stamps and authors of the changes.

Differences between GMU Emacs git repo & ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
I executed the git branch command in the ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs and also in my cloned Emacs repo. In the 
~eggert emacs directory, there are many additional files with the "* master" one, as opposed to the 
single "* master" file in my cloned repo.
