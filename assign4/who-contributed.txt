I used git grep "Even newspaper" command instead of git log | grep "Even newspaper",
since it searches through the source code. This command finds the statement,
"Even newspaper reports present contradictory information," and tells me which
file the line exists in. Now, I can use git blame (file), to annotate the file
with the author and time stamp of each line. I also pipelined it into
grep "Even newspaper". The complete command was
git blame northamerica | grep "Even newspaper" .

This tells me that Paul Eggert added this line to the northamerica source file
on September 9, 2013 at 8:09:06 in the UTC -0700 time zone.
